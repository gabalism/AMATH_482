# AMATH 482: Data Analysis and Signal Processing

This class provided an in depth review for data analysis and signal processing, teaching techniques such Fourier and 
Gabor Transforms, SVD, PCA, Linear classifiers, and Dynamic Mode Decomposition.

## Lecture Topics

### Data Analysis
- Fourier Transforms
- Averaging and filtering in frequency domain
- Gabor Transforms
- Wavelet Transforms

### Image Processing
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Low rank approximation
- Dimensionality analysis of data


## Classification & Clustering

### Supervised Learning
- Linear Discriminant Analysis 
- Support Vector Machines 
- Decision Trees


### Dynamic Mode Decomposition
- Nonorthogonal Mode decomposition
- Extracting spatio-temporal properties


### Reduced Order Modeling
- Solving PDEs by reducing to ODEs 


## Assignments

### Assignment 1
Introduction to filtering. Our case study involves a submarine sending out signals for us to filter and then locate. 
Emphasis on the Fourier Transform and related techniques.

- Fourier Transforms
- Averaging in the Frequency Domain
- Filtering for Frequencies


### Assignment 2
An extension of filtering and an introduction to spectrograms. Different music is filtered using the Gabor 
Transform, where certain frequencies are targeted to isolate a range corresponding to different instruments. 

- Gabor transforms
- Spectrograms
- Music decomposition

### Assignment 3
Using the SVD and PCA to track the movement of a bucket through multiple cameras. Good case study for PCA 
and its shortcomings.

- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Dimensionality Analysis and Low-Rank (dimension) approximations of data
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Assignment 4
Use of PCA and LDA for classification of images. Case study was the MNIST data set. 

- Data Preprocessing
- Classification and Clustering

### Assignment 5

- Dynamic Mode decomposition
